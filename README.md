# Baseline Model for Underwater Military Munitions (UWMM) Detection

This project implements a baseline model for the detection of Under-Water Military Munitions (UWMM), replicating the methodology presented in the paper "Improved supervised classification of underwater military munitions using height features derived from optical imagery" by Gleason et al. (2015). This Python implementation is used to process and analyze different data modalities, including 2D imagery, 3D depth data, and a combined 2.5D representation, to evaluate their effectiveness in identifying Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) in underwater environments.

## Purpose

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* Replicate the findings of Gleason et al. (2015) using Python-based tools.
* Compare the performance of SVM models trained on 2D image data, 3D depth data, and combined texture and depth data (2.5D) for UWMM detection.
* Establish a modular framework for building datasets, training classification models, and conducting inference for UWMM detection tasks.

## Key Features

* **Dataset Generation:** Processes original image, depth, and mask data to create training patches.
* **Multi-Modal Data Handling:** Supports the use of 2D imagery, 3D depth data, and combined 2.5D data for model training and evaluation.
* **SVM Classification:** Implements SVM models for classifying potential UWMM based on extracted features.
* **Trainable Models:** Provides functionality to train classification models on the generated dataset.
* **Inference Pipeline:** Enables the application of trained models to new underwater imagery for UXO detection.

## Getting Started

This section outlines the steps required to use this project. Ensure you have the necessary Python environment and dependencies installed.

### 1. Dataset Creation

This step involves processing the original image/depth/mask data to generate training patches.

**Input Data Format:**

The project expects original data to be organized as images within a directory structure specified by `input_dir` in the `config.yaml` file. The `input_dir` directory is expected to host one or more datasets organized as folders. Within each dataset folder under `input_dir`, the following subdirectories are expected:

* `images`: Contains original 2D imagery.
* `depths`: Contains corresponding depth maps, formatted as 1-channel, 16-bit PNGs.
* `masks`: Contains corresponding masks indicating the location of potential UXOs, formatted as 1-channel, 8-bit PNGs.

***Example:***

```
input_dir/
└── dataset_1/
    ├── images/
    │   ├── img_01.jpg
    │   ├── img_02.jpg
    │   └── ...
    ├── depths/
    │   ├── img_01.png
    │   ├── img_02.png
    │   └── ...
    └── masks/
        ├── img_01.png
        ├── img_02.png
        └── ...
└── dataset_2/
    ├── images/
    │   └── ...
    ├── depths/
    │   └── ...
    └── masks/
        └── ...
└── ...
```

**File Naming Convention:**

Data files within each subdirectory should have the same exact name - excluding the extension - to allow for data matching across different modalities.

**Output:**

Processed image patches (both 2D and 3D representations) will be saved in the `dataset_dir` under subfolders labeled 'background' and the different class names present in the mask.

### 2. Model Training

This step focuses on extracting features from the generated dataset patches and training an SVM classification model.

**Input:**

The training process utilizes the dataset created in the previous step, located in the `dataset_dir`. Optionally, if `use_saved_features` is set to `true` in the `config.yaml`, pre-extracted features from the `features_dir` will be loaded.

**Output:**

* Extracted features (for 2D, 3D, or 2.5D data) will be saved in the `features_dir`.
* The trained SVM model will be saved as a file in the `models_dir`.
* A classification report summarizing the model's performance will be saved in the `results_dir` along with the confusion matrix.

### 3. Inference

This step involves using a trained model to detect potential UXOs in a new, unseen image.

**Input:**

The inference process requires the following inputs, specified in the `config.yaml` file under the `run_inference` section:

* `image_path`: The path to the images folder.
* `depth_path`: The path to the corresponding depth maps folder.

**Output:**

A folder will be created for each trained model inside of `results_dir` where the inference image along with the generated mask will be saved.

### 4. Evaluate Results

This step calculates and saves the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for each inferred image, providing a quantitative measure of each model's performance.

**Input:**

The evaluation process requires the following inputs, specified in the `config.yaml` file under the `evaluate_results` section:

* `mask_path`: The path to the directory containing the ground truth masks.

**Output:**

The evaluation results will be saved in a file named `meanIoU.txt` located within the directory of each model under `results_dir`. This file will contain the mIoU score for each individual image as well as the average mIoU across all images.

## Results

The experimental results, consistent with the findings of Gleason et al. (2015), highlight the varying performance of models trained on different data modalities:

* **2D Model:** Models trained solely on 2D imagery exhibited a tendency to misclassify non-UXO objects, such as scales placed in the scene for measurement or rusted chains lying on the sea floor, as UXOs.
* **3D Model:** Models trained exclusively on 3D depth information demonstrated a high false positive rate, often identifying structures with similar shapes to UXOs as potential targets. These models also struggled with accurately classifying actual UXOs in some instances.
* **2.5D Model:** The model trained on the combined 2.5D data (integrating both 2D and 3D information) achieved the best overall performance. It significantly reduced the number of false positives compared to the 2D and 3D models. However, the 2.5D model did not perfectly capture and classify all UXOs present in the test data.
